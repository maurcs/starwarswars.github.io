		<h2><a href="{{ page.url }}">Jedi Council Rap Battle</a></h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@-Alfox-" target="_blank">Alfox</a> brings us another brilliant parody. Anakin Skywalker, upon learning of his exclusion from the esteemed Jedi Council, doesn't simply express disappointment but unleashes a torrent of angry, frustrated rap lyrics. In response to Anakin's tirade, Mace Windu, playfully boasts about his unique purple lightsaber, which the galaxy knows does not even fit in the sheath. Yoda is up there spinning records. Not sure he needs his hands to do it, but it looks better that way.  But, wait for the end because Obi-Wanâ€™s got something to say! Come for the RAP stay for the Dagobah green.</p>
