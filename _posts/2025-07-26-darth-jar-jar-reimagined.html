    <p>Darth Jar Jar is sinister mastermind behind the Sith's conquest of the Galaxy. This plot goes so deep Disney worked so hard to diguise it. 
          Jar Jar's brilliance is in his, clumsy, idiotic which conceals his true evil nature. Jar Jar is the maestro of many critical events to aid the rise of the Galactic Empire.
