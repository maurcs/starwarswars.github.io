		<p>In 1978 the phenomenon of Star Wars had begun to be realized. Nothing indicated this more than the arrival of the first ever Star Wars parody film. Renie Fosselius and Michael Wiese teamed up to make their own film <em>Hardware Wars</em>. The film follows a young Fluke Starbucker, Princess Anne-Droid, Ham Salad, and Chewchilla on a space adventure pitted agains an evil Darth Nader. Much of the props, ships, and production design resembles common household applinces and tools. It's great. Check it out.</p>
