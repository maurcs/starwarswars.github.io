	<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2K3C7wjKtiJPjq7mL8YRw" target="_blank">stryder HD</a> has gone above and beyond in his Rogue One teaser trailer. Here included are clips not only from the Star Wars saga episodes I-VI but also from other performances from Felicity Jones. They don't quite work, but it's interesting to give a meta-context to the new film... casting known actors as leads is kind of a new thing. Fun to watch regardless.</p>
