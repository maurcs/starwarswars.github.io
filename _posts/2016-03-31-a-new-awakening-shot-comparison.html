		<p>Zachary Antell put together this infomative and beautiful shot comparison of Star Wars Episodes IV and VII. Whether you like it or not there is no doubting the creative team behind The Force Awakens intended to mirror the films that came before it, especially A New Hope. Here Antell displays the De-specialized copy of <em>Star Wars</em> and digital copy of <em>Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens</em> side by side to bring the juxtaposition to full potential. The two tracks used, "Rey's Theme" and "Jedi Steps" are taken from the official soundtrack. Thank you, Zach!</p>
