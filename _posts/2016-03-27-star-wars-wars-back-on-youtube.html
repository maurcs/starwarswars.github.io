		<p>About a month or so ago Star Wars Wars was finally blocked by Sony Classical in "244 countries." (Are there even that many?) At the time my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/maurcs">YouTube account</a> was not in good standing so I could not upload a modified version of the video. Now that my account is back in good standing I have opted to silence the areas of the work that Sony Classical is claiming copyright. The video has been renamed "Star Wars Wars: Episodes I-VI at the same time" to reflect the absense of Episode VII. Because it remains in 360p and has wholes in the audio, the best place to continuing to watching Star Wars Wars on this site. I only re-uploaded it to YouTube to keep a presense there. Have a nice day!</p>
